   <h1>GAME TESTERS NEEDED: Hello, I need some nerds to test out the games I make. If your interested email me or use my preferred form of communication, discord. Please tell me your name, why you want to play test, your age, why I should choose you, and anything else I should know. Warning, some special events may be spoiled for you, so just a warning. I'll also need to trust you before I give you anything that I want to keep secret, so loyalty and trust is a must. Thanks! :)</h1>
